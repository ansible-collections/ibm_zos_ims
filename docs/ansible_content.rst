z/OS IMS
========

The **IBM z/OS IMS collection**, also represented as **ibm_zos_ims**
in this document, is part of the broader offering **Red Hat® Ansible
Certified Content for IBM Z**. The IBM z/OS IMS collection supports tasks
such as generating IMS Database Descriptors (DBD), Program Specification
Blocks (PSB), Application Control Blocks (ACB), and running IMS type-1
& type-2 commands.

The **IBM z/OS IMS collection** works closely with offerings such as the
`IBM z/OS core collection`_ to deliver a solution that will enable you to
automate tasks on z/OS.
