z/OS IMS
========

The **IBM z/OS IMS collection**, also represented as `ibm_zos_ims`_
in this document, is part of the broader initiative to bring
Ansible® Automation to IBM Z through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z**.

The **IBM z/OS IMS collection** supports tasks such as generating
IMS Database Descriptors (DBD), Program Specification Blocks (PSB),
Application Control Blocks (ACB), running IMS commands
(type-1, type-2, DBRC), and interacting with the IMS Catalog.

The Ansible modules in this collection are written in Python and
interact with the `IBM z/OS core collection`_ and
`Z Open Automation Utilities`_.
