module: ims_catalog_purge
short_description: Purge records from the IMS Catalog
version_added: "1.1.0"
description:
  - The IMS Catalog Purge  utility DFS3PU10 removes the segments that represent a DBD or PSB instance,
    all instances of a DBD version, or an entire DBD or PSB record from the IMS catalog. You can also analyze
    the catalog and generate delete statements for ACBs eligible for deletion, as well as update the ACB retention
    criteria.
