short_description: Submit IMS Database Recovery Control (DBRC) Commands
version_added: "2.9"

description:
  - Use DBRC to record and manage information that is stored in a set of VSAM
    data sets that are collectively called the Recovery Control (RECON) data set.
  - Based on this information, you can use DBRC to advise IMS about how to proceed
    for certain IMS actions.
